# pixelplanet will not allow access APIs on that URL, to protect the users
# from cloudflares MitM attack.
# If you do want to run the whole game behind a CDN, you should not set this,
# this option is only useful if you want to serve the bandwidth intensive
# requests on a CDN, and nothing else
# Shall NOT end with "/"

#CDN_URL = https://cdn.pixelplanet.fun

# Requests on this host will not load balance API_URLs, this is only useful
# if you run a seperate second domain that you don't want to share connections
# with the other.
# This option is ignored at best, barely useful
# Shall not include protocol (e.g. "http://")

#UNSHARDED_HOST = fuckyouarkeros.fun

# This is also used for the historical view.

deleted redis stuff:
'isal:*' - isAllowed cache
'isual:*' - isUserAllowed cache, i think that didn't get used yet
'ised:*' - mail provider disposable, i think didn't get used yet
'chip' - HSET for challenge ip mapping, it's stored different now

admin route for matrix that says whether user is muted
